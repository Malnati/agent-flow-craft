# Plano de execução para a issue #53

**Prompt recebido:** Criar um plano de execução automaticamente

**Plano de execução gerado automaticamente:**

## Detalhes do Plano

### Entregável 1: ExecutionPlanGenerator

**Descrição:** A Python class that generates execution plans based on the project's commit history and file structure. The generated plan should be in JSON format and contain detailed information about the plan's deliverables, dependencies, usage examples, acceptance criteria, troubleshooting guide, and implementation steps.

**Dependências:**
- pyautogen>=0.2.0
- pytest>=7.4.0
- pytest-mock>=3.11.1

**Exemplo de uso:**
```
```python
from execution_plan_generator import ExecutionPlanGenerator

epg = ExecutionPlanGenerator()
plan = epg.generate_plan()
print(plan)
```
```

**Critérios de aceitação:**
- The ExecutionPlanGenerator class is implemented and can be instantiated without errors.
- The generate_plan method returns a valid JSON string.
- The generated plan contains all the required fields and their values are realistic and based on the project's commit history and file structure.
- All the existing unit tests pass.
- New unit tests covering the ExecutionPlanGenerator are added and they all pass.

**Resolução de problemas:**
- Problema: The generate_plan method returns an empty string or None.
  - Causa possível: The project's commit history or file structure could not be read.
  - Resolução: Check if the project's commit history and file structure are accessible and in the expected format.
- Problema: The generate_plan method raises an exception.
  - Causa possível: There could be a bug in the ExecutionPlanGenerator's implementation.
  - Resolução: Check the exception's message and traceback for clues about the bug's cause. Then fix the bug and try again.

**Passos de implementação:**
1. Create a new Python file named execution_plan_generator.py.
2. In the new file, define a new class named ExecutionPlanGenerator.
3. In the ExecutionPlanGenerator class, define a new method named generate_plan. This method should read the project's commit history and file structure, generate an execution plan based on them, and return the plan as a JSON string.
4. Write unit tests for the ExecutionPlanGenerator class and the generate_plan method.
5. Run the tests and fix any bugs until all the tests pass.
