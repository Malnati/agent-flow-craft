Okay, let's see. The user wants to add a new parameter called 'target' to the start_feature_agent.py script. This target parameter should point to a Git repository path, and the agent needs to perform actions in that target repository.

First, I need to update the argparse setup in the main function to include the new '--target' argument. The existing code has parser.add_argument for prompt, execution_plan, and other options. I'll insert the new target argument after execution_plan, making it required.

Then, I need to ensure that the provided target path is a valid Git repository. That means checking if the .git directory exists within the target path. If not, the script should log an error and exit.

Next, the FeatureCreationAgent initialization in the main function currently takes token, owner, and repo. But if we're specifying a target directory, maybe the repo owner and name can be derived from the Git remote URL. However, the user might still want to keep the --owner and --repo parameters, so perhaps those should be optional now. Wait, the user's instruction says that target is the repository path, so maybe the owner and repo are no longer needed? Hmm, the original code had --owner and --repo as required. The user's instruction says to add the target parameter, but doesn't mention removing existing ones. So perhaps the target is an alternative way to specify the repository, but the existing owner and repo are still required. Or maybe the target is the local path, and owner/repo are still needed for GitHub API interactions. That's possible. So the owner and repo might still be necessary for creating issues or PRs via the GitHub API, while the target is the local Git repo path.

Therefore, the --target parameter should be added, and the --owner and --repo might remain as required. But the user's problem statement says that the agent should perform actions in the target Git project, so the local operations (like creating branches, etc.) should be done in that directory. Therefore, the FeatureCreationAgent might need to be modified to accept the target path and use it to change the working directory when executing Git commands.

Wait, looking at the existing code, the FeatureCreationAgent has methods like create_branch, which probably runs Git commands in the current working directory. So if we pass the target path, the agent needs to operate within that directory. Therefore, perhaps the agent's methods should be adjusted to run Git commands in the target directory. Alternatively, the script could change the current working directory to the target before invoking agent methods.

But modifying the agent's code might be beyond the current scope since the user only provided start_feature_agent.py. So perhaps in the start_feature_agent.py script, when initializing the agent, we need to pass the target directory to the agent, or change the working directory before executing agent methods.

Looking at the existing FeatureCreationAgent's __init__ method in the provided code (from the user's earlier file summaries), it takes github_token, repo_owner, and repo_name. The create_feature_creation method might be using those to interact with GitHub. But for local Git operations, maybe the agent expects to be in the correct directory. So adding the target parameter would require the script to change directories to the target before running Git commands.

Therefore, in the start_feature_agent.py's main function, after parsing the arguments, we should check that the target path is a valid Git repo, then possibly change the working directory to that path. Alternatively, the agent's methods could be modified to accept a path, but since we don't have the agent's code in the chat, maybe the script handles the directory change.

Wait, the user added src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py to the chat, but the FeatureCreationAgent is from apps.agent_manager.agents.feature_creation_agent, which the user provided summaries for but not the actual code. So we can't modify the agent's code here. Therefore, in the start_feature_agent.py script, we need to handle the target directory by changing the current working directory when executing the agent's methods that interact with Git.

So the steps are:

1. Add the --target argument to the argparse setup.
2. Check if the target path exists and is a Git repository.
3. Change the working directory to the target path before executing Git operations.

But in the current script, after parsing the arguments, the agent is initialized with token, owner, and repo. The agent's methods like create_branch might be running Git commands in the current working directory.

Therefore, in the script's main function, after parsing the args, we should verify the target directory, change into it, and then proceed.

So modifying the main function in start_feature_agent.py:

- Add the --target argument, required=True.
- After parsing args, check if the target is a valid Git repo by checking for .git directory.
- Change the working directory to the target path.

But how does this affect the agent's operations? If the agent's methods execute Git commands via subprocess, they would now run in the target directory.

Therefore, the necessary changes to start_feature_agent.py are:

1. Add the --target argument to the argparse setup.
2. After parsing args, validate the target path is a Git repo.
3. Change the working directory to target.

Now, looking at the existing code in start_feature_agent.py's main function:

The parser setup has:

parser.add_argument("prompt", ...)
parser.add_argument("execution_plan", ...)
parser.add_argument("--token", ...)
parser.add_argument("--owner", ...)
parser.add_argument("--repo", ...)
...

So inserting the --target argument as a required positional argument? Or as an option?

The user says the target parameter must be the repository path. Depending on how the user wants to invoke the script, maybe target is a required positional argument. But the existing positional arguments are prompt and execution_plan. Adding target as another positional would make the script require three positional arguments. Alternatively, making it an option with --target.

But the user's instruction says "adicionar um parâmetro target", which could mean adding a command-line parameter, which is typically an option (--target) rather than a positional. However, the current positional arguments are "prompt" and "execution_plan". So perhaps the target should be an option.

Wait, looking at the user's exact request:

"Preciso adicionar um parâmetro target. O parámetro target deve ser o caminho do repositorio do projeto."

So 'parâmetro' can refer to a command-line argument. In argparse, parameters can be positional or optional. Since the existing 'prompt' and 'execution_plan' are positional, adding another positional would make the order: prompt, execution_plan, target. But that might break existing usage. Alternatively, making it an optional --target parameter, which is required.

So in argparse, adding:

parser.add_argument("--target", required=True, help="Caminho do repositório Git destino")

But the user might prefer it as a positional. However, since the existing two are positional, adding a third could be confusing. Let's check the current code's parser:

Current code:

parser.add_argument("prompt", type=str, help="The user prompt for feature creation.")
parser.add_argument("execution_plan", type=str, help="The execution plan for the feature.")
parser.add_argument("--token", ...)
...

So the first two are positional. The user wants to add a target parameter. The user might expect it to be a required command-line option, so --target.

But the user's examples in the code have options as --token, --owner, etc. So adding --target makes sense.

Therefore, modifying the parser to add:

parser.add_argument("--target", required=True, type=str, help="Caminho do repositório Git destino")

Then, after parsing the arguments, check if the target path exists and is a Git repo.

In the main function:

After parsing args:

if not os.path.isdir(args.target):
    logger.error("Target path does not exist")
    return

if not os.path.isdir(os.path.join(args.target, '.git')):
    logger.error("Target path is not a Git repository")
    return

Then, change the working directory to args.target:

os.chdir(args.target)

Additionally, the existing code has:

agent = FeatureCreationAgent(args.token, args.owner, args.repo)

But if the target is a local repo, perhaps the owner and repo can be derived from the Git config. However, the user's instruction doesn't mention removing --owner and --repo, so they might still be required. So we'll keep them as required arguments.

Wait, the original code had:

if not args.owner or not args.repo:
    logger.error("FALHA - Parâmetros owner/repo ausentes")
    return

But with the target being a local Git repo, maybe the owner and repo can be extracted from the remote URL. However, that's additional work and may complicate things. The user hasn't mentioned removing --owner and --repo, so we should keep them as required and proceed.

Putting it all together:

First, add the --target argument.

Second, validate the target path.

Third, change directory to target.

Modify the argparse section to include --target, then add validation steps.

Looking at the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

In the existing code, the parser setup is:

parser.add_argument("prompt", type=str, help="The user prompt for feature creation.")
parser.add_argument("execution_plan", type=str, help="The execution plan for the feature.")
parser.add_argument("--token", type=str, help="GitHub token", default=os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN"))
parser.add_argument("--owner", type=str, help="Repository owner (obrigatório).")
parser.add_argument("--repo", type=str, help="Repository name (obrigatório).")
...

We need to add the --target argument here. So the SEARCH block would find the lines starting with the parser setup, and insert the new argument.

Then, after parsing the arguments, we need to validate the target path and change directory.

So the SEARCH blocks would target the main function's code after parsing the arguments and before using them.

But wait, the code after parsing does:

if not args.token:
    logger.error(...)
    return

if not args.owner or not args.repo:
    logger.error(...)
    return

Then proceeds.

We need to add the target validation after parsing and before these checks, perhaps.

So SEARCH for:

args = parser.parse_args()
        
if args.verbose:
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logger.debug("Modo verbose ativado")
    
if not args.token:
    logger.error("FALHA - Token GitHub ausente")
    return
        
if not args.owner or not args.repo:
    logger.error("FALHA - Parâmetros owner/repo ausentes")
    return

And modify that block to include the target checks and directory change.

So inserting between args = parser.parse_args() and the token check:

Check target exists and is a Git repo.

Therefore, the SEARCH block will include the lines from args = parser.parse_args() up to the if not args.token check.

Then, the REPLACE block adds the new validation code for target.

Finally, changing the working directory to args.target.

So the steps are:

1. Add the --target argument to the parser.
2. After parsing, validate target path and change directory.

These changes will:

1. Add a new required `--target` parameter to specify the repository path
2. Validate that the target path exists and is a git repository
3. Change the working directory to the target repository before executing any operations

The script will now:
- Require a valid git repository path as input
- Verify the .git directory exists
- Operate within the specified repository directory
- Maintain all existing functionality while working within the target repo

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Okay, the user is encountering a ModuleNotFoundError for the 'core' module when running their script. Let me look at the code they provided in start_feature_agent.py. 

The error happens on line 13 where they try to import from 'core.core.logger'. The user's project structure shows that the core module is located under 'src/core', but the script is in 'src/scripts'. 

Wait, in the script, they added the BASE_DIR as Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent, which would be 'src/scripts/..', so the parent is 'src', and then inserting that into sys.path. But maybe the path is incorrect. Let me check:

BASE_DIR is set to Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent, which would be the directory two levels up from the script. Since the script is in src/scripts, parent.parent would be the project root. Then they insert BASE_DIR into sys.path. But the core module is in src/core, so to import core.core.logger, the path should include 'src', not the project root. Wait, if the project root is added to sys.path, then 'import core.core.logger' would look for a core directory in the project root, but in the user's structure, core is under src. So the path is incorrect.

Ah, right! The user's code structure has core under src/core, but the script is adding the project root to sys.path. So the correct path should be 'src' added to sys.path, not the project root. Let me check the BASE_DIR again. The script is in src/scripts, so Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent would be src/scripts/../.., which is the project root. But the core module is in src/core, so the project root's src directory is where the core package is located. Therefore, the sys.path should include the project root, and the import should be 'src.core.core.logger'? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the project root is the directory containing src, so adding the project root to sys.path would allow imports like 'from src.core.core.logger import ...', but the user's code is trying to import 'core.core.logger'. 

So the issue is that the sys.path is pointing to the project root, but the core module is inside the src directory. Therefore, the correct path to add should be the src directory, not the project root. So the BASE_DIR should be Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent, because the script is in src/scripts, so parent is src/scripts, parent.parent is src, parent.parent.parent is the project root. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If the script is at src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py, then:

Path(__file__) is src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py
.resolve().parent → src/scripts
.parent → src
So BASE_DIR = src

Then, sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR)) would add the src directory to the path. Then, the import would be 'from core.core.logger import ...' because core is a package under src.

Wait, yes! Because if src is in the path, then 'core' is a subdirectory of src, so the import should work. But in the user's code, the BASE_DIR is set to Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent, which is src/scripts/.. → src. Then inserting that into sys.path. So that should be correct. But the error says 'No module named 'core''. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the project structure as shown by the user has the core module under both src/agent_platform/core and src/core. The user provided summaries showing both src/agent_platform/core/agent_factory.py and src/core/core/agent_factory.py. So there might be a duplication. But in the script, the import is from 'core.core.logger', which would correspond to src/core/core/logger.py. But if the sys.path includes the project root (which contains src), then 'core' would refer to src/core, so 'core.core.logger' would be src/core/core/logger.py. But in the user's setup, maybe the core module is not properly installed or the paths are conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the sys.path insertion is incorrect. Let me check the code again:

In the script, they have:

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))

So if the script is in src/scripts, then BASE_DIR is src/scripts/.. → src. So sys.path is prepended with 'src', which is the directory containing the core package. Therefore, importing 'core.core.logger' should work if core is a package under src. But perhaps the src directory is not a Python package because it lacks __init__.py. The user's summaries show src/__init__.py exists, so that's okay.

Wait, but in the user's file summaries, there's both src/core/core/logger.py and src/agent_platform/core/logger.py. So there might be a conflict if both are present. But the script is trying to import from core.core.logger, which would be src/core/core/logger.py. But if that's not the correct logger, maybe the import is wrong. Alternatively, the sys.path is not correctly set.

Alternatively, the user might be running the script from the project root, but the path is not correctly set. Let me see the error message again: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'. That suggests that when the script runs, the 'core' module is not found in the sys.path.

So, possible solutions:

1. Adjust the sys.path insertion to include the correct directory. Maybe the BASE_DIR is calculated incorrectly.

Wait, let's re-calculate:

The script is at src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py.

Path(__file__) is src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py.

.resolve().parent → src/scripts

.parent → src

So BASE_DIR is src. Then sys.path.insert(0, src) allows imports from core (src/core), agent_platform (src/agent_platform), etc.

But the import is 'from core.core.logger import ...', which would require that src/core/core/logger.py exists. Looking at the user's file summaries, they have src/core/core/logger.py, which matches.

So why the ModuleNotFoundError? Maybe when the script is run, the current working directory is different. For example, if the user is running the script from the project root, then the sys.path insertion adds 'src' to the path, but the project root is already in the path. Wait, no. If the script is run from the project root, then the current directory is the project root, which is added to sys.path automatically. But the script adds 'src' to the path. So 'core' would be found in the project root? No, because the core is under src/core. So perhaps the correct path to add is the project root, and the import should be 'from src.core.core.logger import ...'.

Wait, that's possible. Let me think: If the project root is /Users/mal/GitHub/agent-flow-craft, and the script is in src/scripts, then when the user runs it from the project root as 'python src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py ...', the current directory is the project root. The script's BASE_DIR is calculated as src/scripts/.. → src. So sys.path is modified to include 'src'. Then, when trying to import 'core.core.logger', it looks for 'src/core/core/logger.py', which exists. But in the user's case, the error is that 'core' is not found. So why?

Ah, perhaps the issue is that the 'core' directory is not a Python package because it lacks __init__.py files. But according to the user's file summaries, src/__init__.py exists, src/core/__init__.py exists, and src/core/core/__init__.py exists? Wait, the user listed src/core/core/logger.py and src/core/__init__.py. Wait, no: in the summaries, under 'src/core/core/logger.py', the path is src/core/core/logger.py, which suggests that there's a core package under src/core, which itself is under src. So the structure is src/core/core/logger.py. That would mean that to import it, you need 'from core.core.logger import ...', but only if the src directory is in the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct import path is 'src.core.core.logger', but the script is using 'core.core.logger'. That would cause an error if the sys.path doesn't include the project root. Wait, but the sys.path is being set to include the 'src' directory. So if the project root is /project, and src is /project/src, then adding /project/src to sys.path allows 'import core' (from src/core), and then 'core.core.logger' would be the submodule.

But this requires that the 'core' directory under src has an __init__.py. The user's summaries show src/__init__.py, src/core/__init__.py, and src/core/core/__init__.py. Wait, looking back:

In the user's file summaries, they have:

src/core/core/agent_factory.py:
⋮
│BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent
⋮
│logger = get_logger(__name__)
│
⋮
│class AgentFactory:
│    """Fábrica para criar diferentes tipos de agentes"""
│    
│    @classmethod
│    @log_execution
│    def create_feature_agent(cls, github_token=None, repo_owner=None, repo_name=None):
⋮

So src/core/core/agent_factory.py exists, implying that the core module is inside another core directory under src/core. So the structure is:

src/
  core/
    core/
      agent_factory.py
      logger.py
    __init__.py
  __init__.py

So to import logger from src/core/core/logger.py, the import should be 'from core.core.logger import ...', which is what the script is doing. But for this to work, the 'src' directory must be in the sys.path. 

The script adds the 'src' directory to sys.path because BASE_DIR is Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent. Since the script is in src/scripts, parent.parent is src. So sys.path is correctly set. 

But the user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError. Maybe when the script is run, the current working directory is different, and the relative path is not correct. For example, if the user is running the script from the project root, the Path(__file__).resolve() would be absolute, so parent.parent would correctly point to src. But perhaps there's an issue with the way the paths are resolved.

Alternatively, maybe the user's project is not installed, and the Python interpreter can't find the modules. To fix this, adding the project root to the PYTHONPATH might help. 

Another approach is to adjust the sys.path insertion in the script to include the project root instead of the src directory. Let me think: If the script is in src/scripts, then the project root is src/scripts/../.. (assuming the project root is the parent of src). Wait, no. If the project is structured as:

project-root/
  src/
    scripts/
      start_feature_agent.py
    core/
      core/
        logger.py
    ...

Then, the project root is the directory containing src. In that case, to import core.core.logger, the project root should be in sys.path, and the import would be 'from src.core.core.logger import ...'.

But the user's script is trying to import 'core.core.logger', which suggests that the src directory is in the path, allowing 'core' to be a top-level package. 

This is a bit confusing. To resolve the error, perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the sys.path insertion to include the project root instead of the src directory. Let's see:

If the script is in project-root/src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py, then:

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent → project-root/src/scripts/.. → project-root/src

sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR)) → adds project-root/src to the path.

But if the core module is in project-root/src/core/core/logger.py, then the import should be 'from core.core.logger import ...'.

But if the project is structured such that the core module is in src/core (not src/core/core), then the import is incorrect.

Wait, looking back at the user's file summaries, they have both src/agent_platform/core/logger.py and src/core/core/logger.py. This suggests that there are two logger modules in different locations. The script is trying to import from src/core/core/logger.py, but maybe the intended logger is in src/agent_platform/core/logger.py. 

Alternatively, the user might have a duplicated structure, which is causing confusion. But according to the initial problem, the error is that 'core' is not found, which suggests that the top-level 'core' package is not in the path.

To fix this, perhaps the sys.path should include the project root, and the import should be 'from src.core.core.logger import ...'.

Let me adjust the code accordingly:

In the script, change the BASE_DIR to Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent (since the script is in src/scripts, parent.parent.parent would be the project root), then insert that into sys.path. Then the import would be 'from src.core.core.logger import ...'.

Let me test this:

If the script is at project-root/src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py:

Path(__file__) → project-root/src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py

.resolve().parent → project-root/src/scripts

.parent → project-root/src

.parent → project-root

So BASE_DIR = project-root

sys.path.insert(0, project-root)

Then, the import would be 'from src.core.core.logger import ...'.

But the user's current code has 'from core.core.logger import ...', which would not work unless the project-root/src is in the path.

So the error is because the sys.path is pointing to src, but the import is 'core.core.logger', which requires that src is in the path and core is a package under it.

But the user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError, which suggests that the 'core' package is not found. This could be due to the lack of __init__.py files in the core directories.

Looking at the user's file summaries, they have src/__init__.py, src/core/__init__.py, and src/core/core/__init__.py. So the packages should be recognized.

Another possibility is that when the script is run, the current working directory is different, and the relative path is not correct. For example, if the user runs the script from the project root, the absolute path to src is correct, but if they're running from another location, it might not be.

Alternatively, the user might have a virtual environment active, and the paths are not set correctly.

To troubleshoot, perhaps adding print statements to the script to show the sys.path and the BASE_DIR would help, but since I can't run the code, I need to infer.

Given the error, the most likely fix is to adjust the sys.path insertion to include the project root instead of the src directory, and then adjust the import statements to use the full path 'src.core.core.logger'.

So, modifying the script's sys.path insertion and the import statements accordingly.

Here's the plan:

1. Change the BASE_DIR in the script to the project root (parent.parent.parent).
2. Insert the project root into sys.path.
3. Update the import statements to use 'src.core.core.logger' instead of 'core.core.logger'.

Let me create the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for these changes.

I'll fix the import path issue. The error occurs because the script needs to properly reference the core module from the src directory.

Here are the necessary changes:

src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Adicionar o diretório base ao path para permitir importações
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))

from apps.agent_manager.agents.feature_creation_agent import FeatureCreationAgent
from apps.agent_manager.agents.plan_validator import PlanValidator
=======
# Adicionar o diretório base ao path para permitir importações
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent  # Go up one more level to project root
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))

from src.apps.agent_manager.agents.feature_creation_agent import FeatureCreationAgent
from src.apps.agent_manager.agents.plan_validator import PlanValidator
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution
=======
from src.core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Adjust the BASE_DIR to point to the project root directory instead of src directory
2. Add full package paths (src.*) for all internal imports
3. Keep the sys.path insertion to ensure the project root is in Python's module search path

Try running the script again with:

```bash
python src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py "Criar uma autenticação simples" "Adicionar uma autenticação simples user and password only" --target /Users/mal/GitHub/agent-flow-craft-aider --owner Malnati --repo agent-flow-craft
```

Okay, the user is having an issue where the Python script can't find the 'src' module, even though the directory structure seems correct. Let me look at the error message again: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'. Hmm, the import in the script is 'from src.core.core.logger import ...', which should work if the project root is in the Python path. But maybe the way the paths are set up is causing the problem.

Looking at the start_feature_agent.py file, the BASE_DIR is set to the parent's parent's parent, which would be the project root. Then sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR)) adds the project root to the path. So when importing 'src.core.core.logger', Python should look in the project root's src directory. But why isn't it working?

Wait, maybe the project structure isn't a package. Even though there's a src/__init__.py, if the project root isn't set up as a package, Python might not recognize the src directory as a module. Alternatively, the script is inside the src/scripts directory, so when it adds the project root to the path, the 'src' directory is a subdirectory of the project root. So importing 'src.core.core.logger' should work. But the error suggests it's not finding it.

Another possibility is that the user is running the script from the project root, but the PYTHONPATH isn't set correctly. Or maybe the script is being run in a way that the current directory isn't the project root, so the sys.path insertion isn't working as expected.

Wait, in the script, after changing directories to the target repo, maybe that's affecting the imports. But the sys.path was modified before changing directories, so that shouldn't matter. Let me check the code again.

In start_feature_agent.py, the BASE_DIR is calculated as Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent. If the script is in src/scripts, then parent.parent.parent would be the project root. Then sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR)) adds the project root to the path. So when importing 'src.core.core.logger', it should look in project_root/src/core/core/logger.py, which exists.

But the error is happening at the import line. So maybe the project root isn't correctly added to the path. Let me verify the BASE_DIR calculation. If the script is at src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py, then:

Path(__file__) is src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py
.parent is src/scripts
.parent is src
.parent is project root. Wait, no. Wait, the script is in src/scripts, so:

Path(__file__).resolve() would be /project_root/src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py

.parent → /project_root/src/scripts

.parent → /project_root/src

.parent → /project_root

So yes, BASE_DIR is the project root. Then sys.path.insert(0, project_root) adds the project root to the path. So in the project root, there's a 'src' directory. So importing 'src.core.core.logger' should work because 'src' is a package (has __init__.py) and the path is correct.

But the error is ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'. That suggests that Python isn't finding the 'src' module in the project root. Maybe the project root isn't being added correctly to sys.path. Let me check the code again.

Wait, in the script, after inserting the project root into sys.path, the imports are 'from src.apps.agent_manager...' and 'from src.core.core.logger...'. So if the project root is in sys.path, then 'src' is a subdirectory of the project root, and should be importable.

But perhaps the issue is that when running the script from the command line, the current working directory is different. For example, if the user is running the script from the project root, then the project root is already in the path, but the script is in src/scripts. Wait, no, because the script is being called with 'python src/scripts/...', so the current directory is the project root. Then, when the script adds the project root to sys.path, it's redundant, but should still work.

Alternatively, maybe the 'src' directory is not recognized as a package because the __init__.py is empty. But even an empty __init__.py should make it a package.

Another angle: the user mentioned that they have a src/__init__.py file, which is present. So the structure is:

project_root/
  src/
    __init__.py
    scripts/
      start_feature_agent.py
    core/
      core/
        logger.py
    apps/
      agent_manager/
        agents/
          ...

Wait, the logger.py is in src/core/core/logger.py? That seems a bit odd. The path is src.core.core.logger, which would imply that there's a core package inside the src.core module. But if the directory structure is src/core/core/logger.py, then the first 'core' is a package under src, and the second 'core' is a subpackage. But that would require that each directory has an __init__.py. Let me check the files the user provided.

Looking at the files, the user has:

src/core/core/logger.py

But in the provided files, there's no mention of src/core/__init__.py or src/core/core/__init__.py. The user's src/__init__.py is empty, but maybe the subdirectories under src (like core/) don't have their own __init__.py files, making them not packages. So, for example, if src/core doesn't have an __init__.py, then Python won't recognize it as a package, so 'src.core' isn't a valid import.

Ah, that's probably the issue! The directory structure for core is src/core/core/logger.py, but if the parent 'core' directory (src/core) doesn't have an __init__.py, then 'src.core' isn't a valid package. Therefore, the import 'src.core.core.logger' would fail because 'src.core' isn't a package.

So the solution is to ensure that each directory in the import path has an __init__.py file. Specifically, the src/core directory needs an __init__.py, and the src/core/core directory also needs an __init__.py.

Looking at the files the user provided, they have:

src/core/core/logger.py

But there's no mention of src/core/__init__.py or src/core/core/__init__.py. The user's existing files include src/__init__.py (empty), but the core directories under src might be missing their __init__.py files.

Therefore, to fix the ModuleNotFoundError, we need to create __init__.py files in the src/core and src/core/core directories.

So the plan is:

1. Create src/core/__init__.py
2. Create src/core/core/__init__.py

These files can be empty, but their presence tells Python that these directories are packages.

Since the user has added the src directory to the chat, but the core directories might not have their __init__.py files, we need to create them.

But the user hasn't added src/core/__init__.py or src/core/core/__init__.py to the chat yet. So the assistant should ask the user to add those files, or create them as new files.

However, the user has given permission to proceed with edits to the files they've added, but the core directories' __init__.py files are not among them. Therefore, the assistant should propose creating these __init__.py files.

So the correct approach is to create the missing __init__.py files in the appropriate directories.

Thus, the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks would be for creating these new files.

For example:

src/core/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
# Core package initialization
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/core/core/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
# Core subpackage initialization
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

By creating these files, Python will recognize the directories as packages, allowing the imports to work correctly.

After creating these files, the import statements in start_feature_agent.py should resolve correctly, assuming the project root is in sys.path, which it is because the script adds it.

Therefore, the ModuleNotFoundError should be resolved.


</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

I notice the import path issue is because while we have the `src` directory, Python needs the parent directory to be in the Python path to recognize the `src` package. Let's fix the path setup in the script:

src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Adicionar o diretório base ao path para permitir importações
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent  # Go up one more level to project root
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))
=======
# Adicionar o diretório base ao path para permitir importações
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent  # Project root
SRC_DIR = BASE_DIR / 'src'
sys.path.insert(0, str(SRC_DIR))
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Explicitly adds both the project root and src directory to Python's path
2. Ensures the src package is recognized as a proper Python package

Now the imports should work correctly. Let's test it with:

```bash
python src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py "Criar uma autenticação simples" "Adicionar uma autenticação simples user and password only" --target /Users/mal/GitHub/agent-flow-craft-aider --owner Malnati --repo agent-flow-craft
```

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is encountering a ModuleNotFoundError for 'src' when running their Python script. The error occurs in the import statement for src.core.core.logger. 

First, I need to look at the provided files. The start_feature_agent.py script has imports like 'from src.core.core.logger import ...' and the logger.py file is in src/core/core. The user mentioned that the src directory exists with an __init__.py, so it should be a package.

The issue might be with the Python path setup. In the script, they're inserting SRC_DIR and BASE_DIR into sys.path. Let me check those:

BASE_DIR is set to the project root (parent.parent.parent of the script), and SRC_DIR is BASE_DIR / 'src'. They add both to sys.path. But when Python looks for modules, it uses the directories in sys.path. If the project root is /Users/mal/GitHub/agent-flow-craft-aider, then adding the project root to sys.path should allow 'import src.core.core.logger' because the src directory is inside the project root. 

Wait, but maybe the script is being run from the project root, and the target directory is different. The --target parameter is set to /Users/mal/GitHub/agent-flow-craft-aider, which is where the script changes directory to. So when the script runs, the current working directory is the target repo, which might not have the src package in its path. 

But the sys.path modifications are done before changing directories. Let me check the script's code. The BASE_DIR is calculated based on the script's location, not the current working directory. So even after changing to the target directory, the sys.path entries point to the original project's src and root. But if the target directory is a different repository (agent-flow-craft-aider), maybe the src package isn't present there. Wait, no—the user is trying to run the script from their original project (agent-flow-craft), and the target is another directory. But the script's own code is in the original project, so the imports should refer to the src in the original project, not the target. 

Wait, the error is happening when running the script from agent-flow-craft, right? The script is in agent-flow-craft/src/scripts, and when they run it, they're passing --target to another directory. But the script's imports are relative to its own location, not the target. So the sys.path should include the original project's src directory. 

Looking at the start_feature_agent.py code:

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent  # Project root
SRC_DIR = BASE_DIR / 'src'
sys.path.insert(0, str(SRC_DIR))
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))

So if the script is located at src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py, then parent.parent.parent would be the project root (agent-flow-craft). SRC_DIR is project_root/src, which is correct. Adding both project_root and project_root/src to sys.path. 

But when they import 'src.core.core.logger', Python looks for 'src' in the directories in sys.path. Since project_root is in sys.path, and 'src' is a subdirectory there, 'import src.core.core.logger' should work. So why the ModuleNotFoundError?

Wait, maybe the structure is different. The logger.py is in src/core/core/logger.py. So the full module path is src.core.core.logger. But for that to be importable, the src directory must be a package (which it is, since there's an __init__.py), and core must be a subpackage. Let me check the files provided:

The user provided src/__init__.py (empty), src/core/__init__.py (exists?), and src/core/core/logger.py. Wait, the core directory inside src has another core directory? So the structure is src/core/core/logger.py. That would mean the module is src.core.core.logger. But if the directory structure is src/core/core, then the first 'core' is a package, and the second 'core' is a subpackage. But the user's file list shows src/core/core/logger.py, which suggests that the logger is in src.core.core. 

But in the start_feature_agent.py, the import is from src.core.core.logger, which matches that structure. So the import should work if the src directory is in sys.path. 

Wait, but sys.path has both the project root and project_root/src. If the project root is in sys.path, then 'import src.core.core.logger' would look for 'src' in the project root, which exists. So why the error?

Ah, maybe the issue is that when the script is run, the current working directory is changed to the target directory (agent-flow-craft-aider), which might not have the src package. But the sys.path is set before changing directories, so it should still refer to the original project's directories. Unless the target directory is the same as the project root, but the user's command shows --target as a different directory. 

Wait, the user is running the script from the original project (agent-flow-craft), and the target is another directory (agent-flow-craft-aider). The script's code is in agent-flow-craft/src/scripts, and the sys.path is set to include agent-flow-craft and agent-flow-craft/src. So when importing 'src.core.core.logger', it should find it in the original project's src directory. 

But the error says 'No module named 'src''. That suggests that Python isn't finding the src package in any of the sys.path directories. 

Possible issues:
1. The sys.path insertion is incorrect.
2. The directories in sys.path don't actually contain the src package.
3. There's a typo in the import statement.

Looking at the sys.path setup:

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent
For the script at src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py, parent.parent.parent would be the project root (assuming src is a direct child). Then SRC_DIR is project_root/src. 

So sys.path is inserting project_root/src and project_root. So when Python looks for modules, it checks project_root/src first, then project_root. 

In project_root/src, there's a core directory (src/core), but the logger is in src/core/core/logger.py. Wait, that's the problem! If the logger is in src/core/core, then the import should be from core.core.logger, not src.core.core.logger. Because if sys.path includes project_root/src, then 'import core.core.logger' would work. But the current import is 'src.core.core.logger', which would require that project_root is in sys.path, and src is a package there. 

Wait, let me clarify:

If sys.path includes project_root (agent-flow-craft), then 'import src.core.core.logger' would work because src is a package in project_root. 

If sys.path includes project_root/src, then 'import core.core.logger' would work because core is a package in project_root/src. 

But in the current code, sys.path has both project_root and project_root/src. So both imports should work. But the script is using 'src.core.core.logger', which requires that project_root is in sys.path. 

Wait, the user's code has:

sys.path.insert(0, str(SRC_DIR))  # project_root/src
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))  # project_root

So the order is project_root, then project_root/src. But when inserting at position 0, the later insertions come first. So the actual sys.path order is [project_root/src, project_root, ...]. 

So when trying to import 'src.core.core.logger', Python would look in project_root/src first. But in project_root/src, there's no 'src' directory; the 'src' directory is in project_root. So to import 'src.core.core.logger', the project_root needs to be in sys.path, and the code is adding project_root/src and project_root. But in the sys.path, project_root is added after project_root/src. So when the import is 'src.core.core.logger', Python looks in project_root/src for a 'src' package, which doesn't exist. Then it looks in project_root, where 'src' exists. 

So the import should work, but maybe there's a problem with the directory structure. 

Wait, the user's file list shows that src/core/core/logger.py exists. So the structure is:

project_root/
  src/
    __init__.py
    scripts/
      start_feature_agent.py
    core/
      __init__.py
      core/
        __init__.py
        logger.py

Wait, no—the user's files include src/core/core/logger.py, which suggests that inside the src directory, there's a core directory, and inside that another core directory containing logger.py. That would make the module path src.core.core.logger. 

But if the sys.path includes project_root, then 'import src.core.core.logger' should work because project_root has the src package. 

Alternatively, if the sys.path includes project_root/src, then 'import core.core.logger' would work. 

The current code adds both project_root and project_root/src to sys.path, but in the order [project_root/src, project_root]. 

So when the import is 'src.core.core.logger', Python first looks in project_root/src for 'src', which isn't there. Then it looks in project_root, finds 'src', and proceeds. 

So the import should work. But the user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError. 

Possible reasons:
1. The BASE_DIR is not correctly calculated. Let's check the script's location. The script is at src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py. So __file__ is src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py. Resolving the parent three times:

Path(__file__).resolve().parent → src/scripts
.parent → src
.parent → project_root

So BASE_DIR is project_root. SRC_DIR is project_root/src. 

So sys.path is correctly set. 

Another possibility is that the user is running the script from a different location, causing the __file__ path to be incorrect. For example, if they run the script from the project root as 'python src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py ...', then __file__ would be 'src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py', and resolving it would give the correct absolute path. 

Alternatively, maybe the project structure in the user's environment is different. For example, if the src directory is not in the project root, but the code assumes it is. 

Another angle: the user's src/__init__.py is empty. That's okay, but maybe there's an issue with nested packages. For example, if src/core doesn't have an __init__.py, then it's not recognized as a package. But according to the user's file list, src/core/__init__.py exists. 

Wait, the user listed:

src/core/core/logger.py

But also:

src/core/__init__.py

So the structure is:

src/
  __init__.py
  core/
    __init__.py
    core/
      __init__.py
      logger.py

So the full module path is src.core.core.logger. 

In that case, the import statement is correct. 

So why the error? 

Maybe the problem is that when the script is run, the sys.path entries are incorrect. Let me check the actual values. 

In the script, after inserting SRC_DIR and BASE_DIR, what are the paths? 

If the script is run from the project root (agent-flow-craft), then the BASE_DIR would be agent-flow-craft, SRC_DIR is agent-flow-craft/src. 

sys.path is modified to have agent-flow-craft/src and agent-flow-craft. 

So when importing 'src.core.core.logger', Python should find src in agent-flow-craft/src? No, because agent-flow-craft/src is the SRC_DIR. Wait, no: agent-flow-craft/src is added to sys.path. So when you import 'src', Python looks for agent-flow-craft/src/src, which doesn't exist. Then it looks in agent-flow-craft, where src exists. 

Ah, here's the problem! The SRC_DIR is agent-flow-craft/src, which is added to sys.path. So when the code tries to import 'src.core.core.logger', it first looks in agent-flow-craft/src for a 'src' package, which doesn't exist. Then it looks in agent-flow-craft, where 'src' exists. So the import should work, but maybe there's a timing issue or a typo. 

Wait, but the error is 'No module named 'src''. That suggests that even after checking all paths in sys.path, Python can't find the 'src' package. 

Alternative solution: adjust the sys.path to only include the project root, not the src directory. Because the project root contains the src package. 

So in the script, instead of adding SRC_DIR (project_root/src) to sys.path, just add BASE_DIR (project_root). Then the import 'src.core.core.logger' would work because src is a package in project_root. 

Let me test this. If sys.path has project_root, then 'import src.core.core.logger' should work. 

So the fix would be to remove the SRC_DIR from sys.path and only add BASE_DIR. 

Looking at the current code in start_feature_agent.py:

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent  # Project root
SRC_DIR = BASE_DIR / 'src'
sys.path.insert(0, str(SRC_DIR))
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))

This adds SRC_DIR and BASE_DIR to sys.path, but in reverse order because insert(0, ...) adds them to the front. So the order is [BASE_DIR, SRC_DIR, ...original paths]. Wait, no: each insert(0, ...) adds to the front, so the first insert is SRC_DIR, then the second insert is BASE_DIR, which is added before SRC_DIR. So the actual order in sys.path would be [BASE_DIR, SRC_DIR, ...]. 

Wait, no. Let's see:

Initially, sys.path is [original entries].

After sys.path.insert(0, SRC_DIR), sys.path becomes [SRC_DIR, ...original entries].

Then sys.path.insert(0, BASE_DIR), sys.path becomes [BASE_DIR, SRC_DIR, ...original entries].

So the order is BASE_DIR first, then SRC_DIR. 

When importing 'src.core.core.logger', Python first looks in BASE_DIR. In BASE_DIR, there's a 'src' directory (since BASE_DIR is the project root), so it finds src.core.core.logger. 

So the import should work. 

But the user is still getting the error. Maybe there's a typo in the import statement. Let me check the code:

In start_feature_agent.py, the import is:

from src.core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution

Which matches the structure src/core/core/logger.py. 

Hmm. 

Another possibility: the user is using a virtual environment where the src package is not installed, and the script is not properly adding the project root to the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the script is being run with a Python version that doesn't support namespace packages, but the user has __init__.py files. 

Alternatively, the issue could be that the logger.py file is not present in the correct location. But the user provided the content of src/core/core/logger.py, so it should be there. 

Wait, perhaps the user's actual file structure is different from what they described. For example, maybe the logger.py is in src/core/logger.py instead of src/core/core/logger.py. 

But according to the user's provided files, src/core/core/logger.py exists. 

At this point, the most likely solution is to adjust the sys.path to ensure that the project root is included, and that the import is correct. 

Another approach: instead of using absolute imports with 'src', use relative imports or adjust the sys.path to include the project root correctly. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the script is run, the current working directory is changed to the target directory (--target), which is a different repository. But the sys.path is set before changing directories, so it should still refer to the original project's directories. 

Wait, in the script, after parsing the arguments, it checks the target directory and changes to it with os.chdir(args.target). But the sys.path modifications are done before that, so the imports should still work. 

But if the target directory is a different repository that doesn't have the src package, that's okay because the imports are resolved based on the original project's structure. 

So the issue must be elsewhere. 

Alternative idea: the user is running the script from a location where the project root is not correctly resolved. For example, if the script is run from a different directory, the Path(__file__).resolve() might not point to the expected location. 

To test this, the user could print out the BASE_DIR and SRC_DIR in the script to verify they are correct. 

But since I can't run the code, I need to find another way. 

Another possible solution: instead of using 'src.core.core.logger', use a relative import or adjust the sys.path to include the correct directories. 

Alternatively, remove the 'src' part of the import and just use 'core.core.logger', assuming that the project_root/src is in sys.path. 

Wait, if sys.path includes project_root/src (as SRC_DIR), then 'import core.core.logger' would work because core is a package under project_root/src. 

But in the current code, the import is 'src.core.core.logger', which requires that project_root is in sys.path. 

So maybe the solution is to adjust the import to 'core.core.logger' and ensure that SRC_DIR is in sys.path. 

Let me try modifying the import statement in start_feature_agent.py:

Change from:
from src.core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution

To:
from core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution

And ensure that SRC_DIR (project_root/src) is in sys.path. 

In the current code, SRC_DIR is added to sys.path, so this should work. 

But the user's current code has both SRC_DIR and BASE_DIR in sys.path. 

So this change would make the import relative to SRC_DIR. 

This might resolve the ModuleNotFoundError. 

So the steps would be:

1. In start_feature_agent.py, change the import from 'src.core.core.logger' to 'core.core.logger'.
2. Ensure that SRC_DIR is correctly added to sys.path.

Looking at the current sys.path setup:

sys.path.insert(0, str(SRC_DIR))  # project_root/src
sys.path.insert(0, str(BASE_DIR))  # project_root

But the order is [BASE_DIR, SRC_DIR, ...]. 

If the import is 'core.core.logger', then Python would look in BASE_DIR for 'core', which doesn't exist. Then in SRC_DIR (project_root/src), where 'core' exists. So the import should work. 

So modifying the import statement to 'core.core.logger' instead of 'src.core.core.logger' should fix the issue. 

Let me verify this with the user's code:

In start_feature_agent.py:

Original line:
from src.core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution

Proposed change:
from core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution

This would require that project_root/src is in sys.path, which it is. 

Therefore, the error should be resolved by changing the import path.


</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

I'll fix the import paths by adjusting how we reference the core module. The issue is with Python's module resolution when using absolute imports. Here's the fix:

src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from src.core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution
=======
from core.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger, log_execution
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Removes the `src.` prefix from the import since we already added the src directory to sys.path
2. Matches the actual package structure shown in the file list where logger.py is at `src/core/core/logger.py`

The path setup code we added earlier already ensures the src directory is in Python's path:
```python
SRC_DIR = BASE_DIR / 'src'
sys.path.insert(0, str(SRC_DIR))
```

Now the import should resolve correctly. Let's test it:

```bash
python src/scripts/start_feature_agent.py "Criar uma autenticação simples" "Adicionar uma autenticação simples user and password only" --target /Users/mal/GitHub/agent-flow-craft-aider --owner Malnati --repo agent-flow-craft
```
